# Feature: Documentation Website

## 1. Summary

This feature involves creating a dedicated documentation website for `readme-forge`. This website will serve as a central hub for information about the project, including detailed usage guides, tutorials, and examples.

## 2. Intended Functionality

*   **Static Site Generation:** The website will be built using a static site generator like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Jekyll.
*   **Content:** The website will include:
    *   A "Getting Started" guide.
    *   Detailed documentation for every feature and command.
    *   A gallery of example `README.md` files generated with the tool.
    *   A "live demo" or "playground" where users can try out the tool in their browser.
*   **Hosting:** The website will be hosted on a free platform like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.

## 3. Requirements

*   **Static Site Generator:** A static site generator must be chosen and configured.
*   **Content Creation:** The documentation content must be written in Markdown or a similar format.
*   **Hosting Setup:** A hosting provider must be selected and configured.

## 4. Limitations

*   **Maintenance Overhead:** A documentation website requires ongoing effort to keep it up-to-date with the latest features of the tool.
*   **Scope Creep:** The website could become a project in itself. It's important to keep the scope focused on documenting the `readme-forge` tool.

## 5. Dependencies

*   **Core Functionality:** The website can only be created after the core functionality of the `readme-forge` tool is complete and stable.
*   **Domain Name:** A custom domain name (e.g., `readme-forge.dev`) could be purchased, but this is optional.
