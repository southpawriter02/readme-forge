# Feature: Contribution Guidelines

## 1. Summary

This feature involves creating a comprehensive set of contribution guidelines for the `readme-forge` project itself. While the `CONTRIBUTING.md` generation feature is for the *users* of the tool, this feature is for the *developers* who want to contribute to `readme-forge`.

## 2. Intended Functionality

*   **Detailed `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will be created in the root of the `readme-forge` project repository.
*   **Content:** The file will include:
    *   A clear Code of Conduct.
    *   Instructions on how to set up the development environment for `readme-forge`.
    *   Guidelines for submitting bug reports and feature requests.
    *   The process for submitting pull requests (including coding standards, testing requirements, etc.).
    *   Information about the project's architecture and how to get started with development.
*   **Issue and PR Templates:** GitHub issue and pull request templates will be created to standardize the process of submitting issues and PRs.

## 3. Requirements

*   **Project Management:** A clear process for managing contributions must be defined.
*   **Documentation:** The guidelines must be written in a clear and concise manner.
*   **GitHub Templates:** The issue and PR templates must be created in the `.github` directory of the project repository.

## 4. Limitations

*   **Enforcement:** The guidelines are only effective if they are enforced. This requires active maintenance and community management.
*   **Barrier to Entry:** Overly strict guidelines can be a barrier to entry for new contributors. A balance must be struck between quality control and approachability.

## 5. Dependencies

*   This feature is essential for building a healthy and collaborative open-source project. It should be implemented as soon as the project is ready to accept contributions from the community.
